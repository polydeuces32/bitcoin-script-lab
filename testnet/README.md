# Bitcoin Testnet Guide

This guide helps you get started with Bitcoin Script experimentation on testnet.

## What is Testnet?

Bitcoin testnet is a separate Bitcoin network used for testing and development. It uses testnet coins that have no real value, making it safe to experiment with Bitcoin Script without financial risk.

## Getting Testnet Coins

### 1. Get a Testnet Wallet

You can use any Bitcoin wallet that supports testnet:
- **Electrum** (recommended for beginners)
- **Bitcoin Core** (full node)
- **Online wallets** (for quick testing)

### 2. Get Testnet Coins

#### Option A: Testnet Faucets (Easiest)
- **Bitcoin Testnet Faucet**: https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/
- **Coinfaucet**: https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/
- **Testnet Faucet**: https://testnet.help/en/btcfaucet/testnet

#### Option B: Bitcoin Core Testnet
1. Install Bitcoin Core
2. Run with `-testnet` flag
3. Generate address: `bitcoin-cli -testnet getnewaddress`
4. Use faucets to send coins to your address

### 3. Verify Your Coins

Check your balance:
```bash
# If using Bitcoin Core
bitcoin-cli -testnet getbalance

# If using Electrum
# Check balance in the wallet interface
```

## Using This Lab

### 1. Generate Scripts

Run the example scripts to create different Bitcoin Script addresses:

```bash
# Basic 2-of-2 multisig
node scripts/multisig.js

# Timelock script
node scripts/timelock.js

# Escrow script
node scripts/escrow.js

# Hash lock script
node scripts/hashlock.js
```

### 2. Fund Your Scripts

1. Copy the generated address from the script output
2. Send testnet coins to that address using your wallet
3. Wait for confirmation (usually 1-6 blocks)

### 3. Test Spending

Use the web interface (`multisig-stx-btc/src/index.html`) to:
1. Create transactions spending from your script addresses
2. Sign transactions with the private keys
3. Broadcast transactions to testnet

## Testnet Block Explorers

Monitor your transactions:
- **Blockstream Testnet**: https://blockstream.info/testnet/
- **BlockCypher Testnet**: https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/
- **Mempool Testnet**: https://mempool.space/testnet/

## Common Testnet Addresses

- **P2PKH**: Start with `m` or `n` (testnet)
- **P2SH**: Start with `2` (testnet)
- **Bech32**: Start with `tb1` (testnet)

## Safety Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: 
- Never use testnet private keys on mainnet
- Testnet coins have no value
- Always verify you're on testnet before sending real Bitcoin

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds" error
- Make sure you've sent enough testnet coins
- Wait for transaction confirmation
- Check the address balance on a block explorer

### "Script validation failed"
- Verify you're using the correct private keys
- Check that the script matches the address
- Ensure you're following the spending conditions

### "Transaction rejected"
- Check the transaction fee
- Verify the script is valid
- Make sure all required signatures are provided
